\section*{\textit{Acknowledgments}}

\vspace{2mm}
First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the University of Pisa and the Scuola Normale Superiore for giving me the opportunity to mature my studies in a vibrant and academically rich environment.  \\\\
\noindent I would like to thank my thesis advisor Nicola Tasinato for providing me with the opportunity to work on this project and for following me during these months. \\\\
\noindent I would also like to thank Silvia De Nardo, without her help and patience I would not have been able to complete this project. \\\\
\noindent I cannot forget to thank my friends Silvano and Samuele, for their unfailing support and continuous encouragement over the years.  \\\\
\noindent Finally, a special thanks goes to my parents, sisters and brother, who have been by my side from the very first step. Thank you.
